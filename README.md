# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware for the Geeetech A10
<img align="right" src="buildroot/share/pixmaps/logo/marlin-250.png" />

This fork of Marlin 1.1.9 was created to provide ongoing firmware updates for the Geeetech A10 3D printer model. Its goal is to replicate the "out-of-the-box" experience of the stock firmware by using known-good configuration values and focusing on features that the majority of users will find a necessity.

Marlin 1.1.9 is the final release of the AVR-only flat version of Marlin Firmware, so there will be no further 1.1.x releases. However [`bugfix-1.1.x`](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-1.1.x) will continue to receive patches for critical bugs. These will be merged here as soon as possible.

Work on Marlin 2.0 support is planned to commence on its first production release.

Similar Geeetech printers like the A10M are currently not explicitly supported for lack of testing hardware.

## Contributing to Marlin-Geeetech-A10

Contributions of any kind are highly welcome. This especially includes testing and tweaking the configuration. If you find that a value other than the default works better for you, please [search for an open issue](https://github.com/jakobend/Marlin-Geeetech-A10/issues) about it or open one if you don't find one.
